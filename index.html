            <h3>Time is money</h3>
            <p>If we truly love something, we spend (or invest?) time in it. As time is a valuable resource, when invested, it makes the person, goal or activity even more important for us.Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day – and later realizing that you never make up for the lost time: the cycle familiar to any of us. While it is not possible to completely avoid it, we should never forget that we can’t reclaim the time we wasted, and spend it on things we love and need.</p>
